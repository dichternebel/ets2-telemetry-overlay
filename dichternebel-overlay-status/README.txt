To use it, just add a Browser Source to OBS, set width and height to 1920 x 1080 and copy the URL from the ETS2/ATS Telemetry server into. Should be something like:
http://127.0.0.1:25555/dashboard-host.html?skin=dichternebel-overlay-status

If you need a different solution, change the width in config.json and OBS browser source accordingly.

The overlay is displayed only if you have currently an active job!
Furthermore it will only be displayed when driving, not in the menu.

Enjoy!
